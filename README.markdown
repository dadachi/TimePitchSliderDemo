This iOS app changes pitch and time of an iTunes library song.  

This is based on the following:  
- [TimeSliderDemo and PitchSliderDemo](http://www.subfurther.com/blog/2012/10/30/cocoaconf-portland-12-and-the-audioqueueprocessingtap/)  
- [MediaPlayerDemo](https://github.com/davidcairns/MediaPlayerDemo)

Bug:  
- Audio is distorted.  
- You can not change pitch and time of the song which you bought on iTunes.
